In this analysis, I focus on major\nattributes to see relationship between common variables such as;\nPotential & wages.\nReputation & Value.\nReputation and wages\nHeight and potential.\nI also answer questions such as; what are the height, wage, weight\nand age distribution of players? What is the prevalent foot amount\nplayers? What are the countries with the highest representation in the\ndata? What are the most common player position? Who are the highest paid\nplayers?
