In this analysis, I focus on major\nattributes to see relationship between common variables such as\nPotential, wages, Reputation, Value and other player information.\nWe know that most soccer players tend to be portrayed by social media\nas extremely gifted players who can do crazy stunts with their feet. In\ntoday’s analysis, I will focus on debunking this myth that soccer\nplayers actually extremely gifted.\nHere\nis the analysis of some Player demographics: Height, age, Weight\nUsing the FIFA 22 data set we get access to some interesting\nvariables and can conduct detailed analyses. If we were to take a look\nat the actual player demographics, we can see whether there may or may\nnot be a truth to the myth regarding soccer player.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see the histograms of the distribution of the “Height in\ncm”, “Weight in kgs” and “Age” of the players.\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from each graph?\nA = A shows the distribution of age of all the players in the FIFA 22\ndata set. We can see that centered around the age of 26, with uni modal,\nsymmetrical shape that appears to be right skewed . There is a fairly\nlarge range for the data with ages ranging from 15 to 40. Most players\ndo hit their prime in their early 20s so it makes sense that the data is\ncentered around the age of 22 and with a right skew.\nB = B shows that the distribution of weight is actually fairly\nnormal/symmetrical and unimodal. The center of the data looks to be\naround 75kgs with a range between 60 to 90 kgs. This is not surprising\nbut debunks the myth of how people think players are almost god like. If\nwe look here we see that most of the players are within the normal range\nof weight. No similar to the rest of us. This also makes sense as\ndefenders tend to need to be more physically built and heavier while\nattackers usually need to be quick and hence prefer weigh lesser.\nC = C shows that the distribution of height is, again, fairly\nnormal/symmetrical . The center of the data looks to be around 180 cms\nwith a range between 160 to 200 cms. However, there is appears to be\nbimodal as there seem to be two prominent peaks. This suggests that\nplayers tend to get clustered into two groups of heights and not a lot\nof players who are in between the two peaks actually exist. Firstly, we\ncan see that the height of all the players is similar the average human\nheight even if it is slightly left-skewed from the world. We can see\nhere that most players are, in fact, around the average height but there\nare also a lot of players who are above the avergae height. This is not\nsurprising because of the requirements of Defenders and Attackers often\nneeding to head the boal to protect or score a goal.\nTherefore, it is clear that soccer players are similar to humans but\nlets actually take a look at how the compare with each other in terms of\ntheir actual attributes.\n\n\n\nFrom these various graphs we can learn a lot about the attributes of\nmost players: A: This graph is depicting the distribution of pace for\nplayers. It has center of 70 with a range between 40 to 90. This\ntranslates to range of about 12 to 20 seconds to complete a 100 m race.\nMost people who are physically fit and healthy can easily run at that\npace. Moreover, the distribution is again unimodal and symmetrical\nindicating that a lot of players live within this range. This is again\ndebunks the myth that soccer players are crazy fast as most players can\nactually run at normal speed.\nB: This graph is depicting the distribution of dribbling for players.\nIt has center of 75 with a range between 30 to 90. Moreover, the\ndistribution is unimodal but left skewed indicating that a lot of\nplayers live within this range. However, this is where we come to see\nwhy soccer players are great. It takes immense practice to be able to\ngain the skills of ball control like them and there is still a very\nlarge range inters of players capabilities in handling the situation.\nThis we cannot speak towards whether we can learn anthing from this\nstat.\nC: This graph is depicting the distribution physicality and toughness\nof players. It has center of 70 with a range between 30 to 90. Moreover,\nthe distribution is again unimodal but only a slight left skewed. This\nis indicating that a lot of players again live within this range,\nhowever, this is where we come to see why soccer players can be\nconsidered crazy again. Even with their normal wight, and height, soccer\nplayers are definately much more physically well-built, tough and\nstrong.\nD: This graph is depicting the distribution of Passing for players.\nThis arguable most symetrical graph with a center of 60 with a range\nfrom 30 to 90. This graph is unimodal and shows that players do tend to\nhave higher passing statistics in general but again we can see a large\nrange here.\nE: This graph is depicting the distribution of Physic for players. It\nhas center of 50 with a range between 30 to 90. Most people who are\nphysically fit and healthy can easily run at that pace are never able to\nachieve this level of physicallity with intense discipline. Moreover,\nthe distribution is again unimodal and symmetrical indicating that a lot\nof players live within this large range. This is again debunks the myth\nthat soccer players are crazy strong or big as most players can actually\nfall all across the range.\nF: This graph is depicting the distribution of Defending for players.\nThis probably the most interesting graph as we see almost a bimodal\nrelationship with a large range between 10 and 90. This is not\nsurprising as attackers are usually very bad at defending. So if you\nassumed that any soccer player must be amazng at defending, it is only\ndue to practice and the data shows no specific center.\nThus we can see how there player demographics and understanding of\nthe distribution of the players attributes can shed light on the false\nperception we have about players in sports. In the next section, I will\ndive deeper by looking at how these attributes can shed light on some of\nthe ways in which we can see how players utlize their skills to perform\nwell in games. Its really an effect of practice and less about raw\nphsyical talent.\nUnderstanding wages and\nvalue\n\n\n\nIf we were to study the above counter map. This map looks at the\ninteraction of the player attributes of defending and passing. Often\ntimes defenders must be great passers, but as we can see here, great\npassers don’t need to be good at defending. This is seen when see that\nthere are two elevations around (30, 50) and at (60, 60). The passing\nattribute is also spread across the map but the defending like in the\ndistribution we saw earier has almost a bimoal relationship. This means\nthat being good at passing is essential to becoming better and it’s not\nthat defenders are automatically good at passing either.\n\n\n\nNow when we take a look at this counter map, we can see how pace and\ndribbline are quite interelated. There is an elevation at (70, 65) which\nis fairly high for players and there seems to be positive trend in the\nrelationship between these two varibales. We can see that as pace\nincreasing the dribbling scores also go up with it. This could show the\nimportance of practice as a lot of soccer drills actually involve speed\ntraining, acceleration, positioning all with the ball. They may be some\nlevel of interaction due to other factors but that does not mean that\nsoccer players are again very fast and very good at dribbling.\nThe previous assessment is however quite doubtful so lets look at\nsome further evidence as to how speed varies across the players\ninternational reputation. From the density graphs below, we can identify\nthat higher the international reputation, there is likely to be higher\nrange when a player gets better at football. We can see players that\nwith a score of 5 (Very reliable) have their peak at a higher pace and\ncover a larger range in comparison to player who had a score of 1\n(Unreliable). Thus we can see the better players tend to have a higher\npace and also tend to be more reliable when they have a higher pace.\nRegardless, we can also still see a large distribution or range for the\npace of players.\n\n\n\nThus we come to an interesting varible to study: The work rate. ork\nRates dictate where players position themselves on the pitch. Also known\nas Player Work Rate, it is the rate of a player’s behaviour on the pitch\nin terms of attacking and defensive works. The Work Rate is defined for\nAttacking (Attacking Work Rate – Abbreviated as AWR) and Defensive\n(Defensive Work Rate – Abbreviated as DWR) and rated between low, medium\nand high, which defines how a player puts effort to participates in\nattacks and defenses even when they are out of position.\nA high attacking work rate implies that the player is going to be in\nall of your attack moves. With medium, he will select the attack actions\nhe will join. A player with low attacking work rate will remain in his\nposition while the team attacks. With the defense, it is exactly the\nsame but in the opposite direction.\nWhat can we learn from the previous graph from a glance. Most of the\nplayers work rate tend to be highly associated with the normal body\ntype. As players work rate increase, whether attacking or defending, the\nplayers also seem to have normal weight and a normal body type. Only the\nlow-low work rate members so a higher level of stocky build while the\nleaner players seem to show a higher work rate, be in attacking or at\ndefending.\n\n\n\nMoreover, when we comee back to the assessment of international\nrepution we can see how well correlated it is with a players potential.\nAs a player gets older, they are more likely to be given a higher\npotential. Each individual in FIFA has a pre-programmed player potential\nwhich determines how fast their attributes should grow and when they\nshould stop. You can think of it as a player’s predicted or peak overall\nrating. This is how we know which players are going to be wonderkids.\nWhile the scatterplot below may show no relationship with the player\nvalue or potential, when we include the color as international\nreputation, we can see how player with higher international reputation\ntend to be clustered around a higher a higher value and potential. Thus\nwe can see that although players with lower potential dont possess all\nthe stats required they will become better as they age and continue to\nplay better.\n\n\n\nWe can bring this all together by taking a look at the graph below.\nIn the scatterplot there are four broad variables being studied. We can\nsee a positive trend occuring between mental composure and overall\nrating. This also consistent with the international reputation and the\nwork rate of the players as we can see the players international\nreputation and work rate increasing with the overall rating.\n\n\n\nThus, I think it is pretty clear that while soccer players may seem\ninhuman, they are actually very much similar to most of us. We saw this\nwhen we analyzed the distribution of the players scores when we\nconsidered the background attributes and skills of that soccer players\nneed. We can also see how training is integral to becoming a better\nplayer by looking at so many variables like age play a role in the\npotential of a player. Most soccer players are extremely good and can\npossibly be just as good. It is only through training and practice that\nthese players are capable of getting a higher over all rating and are\nmentally strong enough to take on the challenge. Thank you!\n\n\n\n",
